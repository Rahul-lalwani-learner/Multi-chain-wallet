## 🚀 Overview

This is a sophisticated multi-chain cryptocurrency wallet application built with Next.js that supports both Solana and Ethereum blockchains. The wallet implements industry-standard HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) wallet architecture using BIP39 mnemonic phrases and BIP44 derivation paths for secure key management and multi-account support.

## 🔐 Core Cryptographic Concepts

### Mnemonic Seed Phrases (BIP39)
A mnemonic phrase is a human-readable representation of entropy that serves as the master seed for your entire wallet. This application uses 12-word mnemonic phrases generated according to the BIP39 standard.

**How it works:**
- **Entropy Generation**: The application generates 128 bits of cryptographically secure random data
- **Checksum Addition**: A 4-bit checksum is appended, making it 132 bits total
- **Word Mapping**: These 132 bits are divided into 12 groups of 11 bits each, and each group maps to a word from the BIP39 wordlist (2048 words)
- **Seed Derivation**: The mnemonic phrase is combined with an optional passphrase and processed through PBKDF2 to generate a 512-bit master seed

### HD (Hierarchical Deterministic) Wallets (BIP32/BIP44)
HD wallets allow you to generate an unlimited number of private keys from a single master seed in a deterministic way.

**Derivation Path Structure (BIP44):**
```
m / purpose' / coin_type' / account' / change / address_index
```

**For this wallet:**
- **Solana**: `m/44'/501'/0'/0'/{index}` (coin_type 501 for Solana)
- **Ethereum**: `m/44'/60'/0'/0/{index}` (coin_type 60 for Ethereum)

**Benefits:**
- **Single Backup**: One mnemonic phrase backs up all your accounts
- **Deterministic**: Same mnemonic always generates the same keys in the same order
- **Privacy**: Each transaction can use a different address while being controlled by the same master key
- **Organization**: Hierarchical structure allows for organized key management

### Key Derivation Process
1. **Master Seed**: Generated from mnemonic phrase using PBKDF2
2. **Master Private Key**: Derived from master seed using HMAC-SHA512
3. **Chain Code**: Additional entropy for key derivation
4. **Child Keys**: Generated using parent key + chain code + index
5. **Public Keys**: Derived from private keys using elliptic curve cryptography
6. **Addresses**: Generated from public keys using blockchain-specific hashing

## 🛡️ Security Features

### Password-Based Encryption
- **AES-256-GCM Encryption**: Mnemonic phrases are encrypted using industry-standard AES-256-GCM
- **PBKDF2 Key Derivation**: User passwords are strengthened using PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- **Salt Generation**: Unique salt for each encryption to prevent rainbow table attacks
- **Authentication Tag**: GCM mode provides built-in authentication to detect tampering

### Secure Storage
- **Browser Local Storage**: Encrypted data is stored locally in the browser
- **No Server Storage**: Private keys never leave your device
- **Memory Protection**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory when possible
- **Password Confirmation**: Critical operations require password verification

### Security Best Practices
- **Zero Trust**: Application assumes no external service can be trusted
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only necessary permissions are requested
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security protection
- **Secure Defaults**: All security features are enabled by default
